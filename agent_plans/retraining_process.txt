3. Efficient retraining on deeper patterns
Principle: Retrain on principles, not details.
Efficient retraining process:
Point to QUICK_CONTEXT.md first (fastest context load)
"Read QUICK_CONTEXT.md first - it points to everything else"
Then point to AGENT_TRAINING_GUIDE.md (principles and patterns)
"Read AGENT_TRAINING_GUIDE.md - especially sections on User Communication Preferences and Common Pitfalls"
Reference specific sections (don't re-read everything)
"Focus on: Questions as guidance mechanism (section 4), Planning workflow (section 8), Common pitfalls #6-9"
Use comparison.txt as a reminder
"Read logs/AI/comparison.txt to understand what deeper patterns you might miss"
Pattern from training docs: The training documents are designed to be the retraining mechanism - they capture the systematic approach, not just corrections.
Recommendation for your workflow
For this session (planning/discussion):
Keep exchanges focused on principles
Reference documents instead of re-explaining
Delegate execution to other agents
Update architecture docs immediately when decisions are made
For execution agents:
Point them to QUICK_CONTEXT.md + specific slice files
They don't need full training guide - just the slice file + QUICK_CONTEXT
Retraining trigger:
After 2-3 hours of active conversation, or
When you notice first warning sign, or
Before starting a new major planning cycle
Retraining process:
"Read QUICK_CONTEXT.md"
"Read AGENT_TRAINING_GUIDE.md sections 4, 8, 10"
"Read logs/AI/comparison.txt to understand deeper patterns"
This keeps token usage low while preserving principles.
